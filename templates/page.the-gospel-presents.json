We spent ages trying to find it. We went along all these hallways, getting lost. We finally saw this open door and a wall of records was inside. There was just this dude chain smoking cigars in this tiny little office that had records stacked up everywhere with no categorisation whatsoever. [...] it’s fun finding a place like that which is a total nightmare. It just makes it more of an adventure.”<\/p>",
