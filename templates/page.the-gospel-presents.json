Considered one of the founding fathers of hip-hop music, GZA is one of the most recognisable music artists in the world. <br\/><br\/>Beyond his musical prowess, GZA has also been a lifelong aficionado of chess, a strategic game that has influenced his approach to life and art. GZA's love for chess often manifested in his lyrics, as he drew parallels between the game and the harsh realities of street life. He used chess metaphors to describe the strategic moves and calculated risks he took in his music career, and his lyrics were often filled with clever wordplay and complex rhyme schemes that mirrored the tactics of a skilled chess player.<br\/><br\/>His unique blend of music and chess has made him a true icon in both the hip hop and chess communities, earning him the title of ‘The Genius of Chess’ from his fans and peers alike. Today, GZA's legacy continues to inspire aspiring musicians and chess players alike, as he remains a respected figure in both worlds.<\/p>",

We spent ages trying to find it. We went along all these hallways, getting lost. We finally saw this open door and a wall of records was inside. There was just this dude chain smoking cigars in this tiny little office that had records stacked up everywhere with no categorisation whatsoever. [...] it’s fun finding a place like that which is a total nightmare. It just makes it more of an adventure.”<\/p>",
